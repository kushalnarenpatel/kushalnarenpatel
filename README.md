### Hi, I'm Kushal 👋

⚡ I have experience in <b>Backend Software Engineering, Cloud and DevOps</b> following an internship & placement year at <b>PwC London</b>.  

⚡ Currently a <b>final year BSc Computer Science student</b> at the University of Birmingham.  

⚡ Open to work <b>July 2023</b> onwards :wave:

Overview of my experience as a Software Engineer (primary role) & Metaverse Consultant:

<b>Optimisation Engine (March 2022 – August 2022)</b>  
•	Led the architecture design and software development of a service accessed via an API which could be used to run optimisation models on given datasets using cloud computing resources, rather than locally on staff laptops.  
•	This resulted in an average 6x reduction in runtime. Implemented further functionality to analyse memory requirements and provision the optimal compute instance, leading to a 30% reduction in cost with no reduction in performance. (Kubernetes, Docker, Golang, Terraform, Google Cloud Platform, REST APIs)  

<b>Speech-to-Text tool (September 2021 – February 2022)</b>  
•	Developed and integrated a tool with the firm’s productivity platform that allows ~22,000 staff firmwide to automate transcriptions of audio / video files eg. meetings. I developed and deployed the backend as a microservice and experimented with different models to increase transcription accuracy.  
•	Following rigorous testing, the transcriptions were on average 96% accurate & resulted in a time saving of ~85% as compared to the manual process. (Kubernetes, Docker, Golang, Terraform, Python, Google Cloud Platform, Azure DevOps, Agile, multithreaded programming)  

<b>Meta (client) – Metaverse Advisory (March 2022 – August 2022)</b>  
•	Instrumental writer and researcher for 5 advisory documents on the past, present and future of the metaverse.

:rocket: <i>What I am working on now:</i> I am using my experience in <b>developing SaaS products</b> to <b>help homeowners</b> with the cost of living crisis by creating a <b>comparison service for energy saving home improvements</b>. Given a user's <b>postcode</b> and <b>annual energy bill</b>, the tool will be able to provide them with <b>energy saving solutions</b> to fit their budget and payback time eg. solar panels, insulation.

:white_check_mark: I would especially like to work at a company which has tech at its heart and is dedicated to the mentorship and success of its employees.
